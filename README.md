# Time Keeper Clock With Pips Alert

A simple and effective clock application that marks the hour and half-hour with the original BBC Radio Pips sounds. If you find yourself losing track of time while working, coding, or just getting lost in your tasks, this non-invasive app will help you stay mindful of the passing hours.

## Features

- **Hourly and Half-Hour Alerts:** A quick "pip" sound plays at the top of each hour and the half-hour mark to remind you of the time.
- **Non-Intrusive:** Designed to be subtle and non-disruptive, allowing you to stay focused on your work while still being aware of the passing time.
- **Original BBC Radio Pips Sounds:** Authentic sounds reminiscent of the original BBC Radio time signals.

## Future Enhancements

I have several features planned to enhance this application, including:

- **Customizable Alert Sounds:** Choose your own alert tones or sounds to mark the time.
- **Adjustable Time Intervals:** Set alerts at custom intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes, every hour, etc.).
- **Visual Notifications:** Add visual indicators along with sound alerts for more accessible reminders.
- **Persistent Notification History:** Keep track of all alerts in a log, helping you to review your productivity throughout the day.

Due to time constraints, these features haven't been implemented yet, but I welcome contributions! Feel free to fork the repo, add your enhancements, and submit pull requests.
